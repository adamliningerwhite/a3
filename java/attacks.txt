1. Mallory can always read the contents of messages sent without encryption.  When Alice sends a message to Bob, Mallory will intercept it and print its contents. 

-------------------------------------------------------

2. Again, Mallory can always read unencrypted messages. The protocol for reading these messages is the same as #1. 

-------------------------------------------------------

3. After intercepting a message, Mallory prints a list of options to the console and lets the user choose how to proceed.  Type "3" then hit "enter" to edit the message.  Type the new message you want to send, then hit "enter" again to send. 

-------------------------------------------------------

4. This attack is not possible for our system.  Mallory doesn't know the shared key for symmetric encryption, so she tries to encrypt messages using her own AES key and send these to Bob.  When Bob tries to decrypt these messages, he encounters a BadPaddingException caused by the fact that different keys are used for encrypting and decrypting.

-------------------------------------------------------

5. This attack only works after at least one message has been sent.  When Mallory prompts the user for how to proceed, type "4" then hit "enter" to replay the prior message.  We didn't have sufficient time (or energy) to implement message numbering and verification, which could've prevented such replay attacks.
